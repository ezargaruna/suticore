# bootstrap ∴ initialization layer

first contact  
with the suticore system ⟁  

bootstrap defines  
how silence becomes structure  
before any execution ∴  

this is not setup  
of software or environment  

this is setup  
of attention 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

establish minimal coherence  
between human · system · action ∴  

remove external noise  
before interaction begins ∅  

prepare perception  
for canonical reading 〄  

bootstrap =  
entry into clarity.  

---

## 1. activation moment ⧖

bootstrap begins  
when one of the following appears:  

loss of orientation ∅  
semantic overload ⧖  
decision paralysis ⟁  
external pressure spike ∅  

signal detected →  
pause immediately ↺  

do not continue activity.  

---

## 2. zero state protocol ∅

first operation:  

stop all inputs  
for 30–90 seconds ⧖  

no reading  
no scrolling  
no talking  
no planning  

only breathing  
and sensory presence ∴  

goal =  
return to neutral baseline 〄  

---

## 3. minimal orientation check ⟁

after silence  
verify three anchors:  

**body** ∴  
breath stable · tension reduced.  

**space** ⧖  
clear awareness of surroundings.  

**intent** ⟁  
one simple direction visible.  

if any missing →  
extend silence ↺  

bootstrap cannot continue  
without stability ∅  

---

## 4. canonical entry 〄

once stable  
re-enter system through:  

one short canonical text ∴  
or one structural protocol ⟁  

no browsing  
no random exploration ∅  

entry must be  
intentional and limited ⧖  

purpose =  
restore structural perception 〄  

---

## 5. first micro-step ↺

bootstrap completes  
only after:  

one real action  
≤ 10 minutes ⟁  

action must:  

exist in physical reality ∴  
close a tiny loop 〄  
require zero motivation ∅  

example forms:  

open required document  
rename one file  
write one factual line  

small step  
restarts agency.  

---

## 6. failure recovery ∅

if bootstrap breaks  
into distraction or urgency:  

stop immediately ∴  

return to  
zero state silence ⧖  

wait ≥ 2 minutes  
before retry ↺  

no self-analysis allowed.  

recovery must stay  
simple and quiet 〄  

---

## 7. daily bootstrap rhythm ⧖

recommended natural moments:  

after waking ∴  
before work transition ⟁  
after emotional disturbance ⧖  
before sleep boundary 〄  

frequency is flexible  
clarity is mandatory ∴  

bootstrap is used  
only when needed ∅  

---

## 8. relation to system layers ⟁

**verenitya** ∴  
creates silence baseline.  

**syntaxium** ∴  
restores structural perception.  

**slovoyaz** ∴  
compresses intent to core.  

**run** 〄  
converts clarity into action.  

bootstrap precedes  
all execution ↺  

without bootstrap  
run becomes noise ∅  

---

## 9. completion signal 〄

bootstrap ends  
when three signs appear:  

breath calm ∴  
one clear next step ⟁  
absence of inner pressure ⧖  

after this  
system may proceed  
to run protocol 〄  

no further preparation required.  

---

## status ∴

initialization protocol active  
version ∴ 2026.x  

architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

bootstrap state ∴  
silent · minimal · ready.  

〄 end of bootstrap
