# run ∴ execution layer

practical entry  
into the suticore field ⟁  

this directory defines  
how the system moves  
from structure → action ∴  

not theory  
not interpretation  
only execution 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

convert semantic clarity  
into a real step ∴  

prevent infinite reflection ∅  

stabilize movement  
through minimal action 〄  

run =  
place where silence  
becomes behavior.  

---

## 1. entry condition ⧖

execution begins  
only if three signals exist:  

clarity ≥ minimal threshold ∴  
time window available ⧖  
pressure = absent ∅  

if any missing →  
return to pause ↺  

no forced action allowed.  

---

## 2. core execution loop 〄

default suticore cycle:  

**∴ node**  
identify the real center.  

**⧖ friction**  
detect resistance or noise.  

**⟁ step**  
perform one concrete action  
≤ 10 minutes.  

**〄 closure**  
finish · record · release.  

cycle repeats ↺  
only after closure.  

no stacking of unfinished steps ∅  

---

## 3. step requirements ⟁

a valid step must be:  

real-world executable ∴  
time-bounded ≤ 10 min ⧖  
independent of motivation ∅  
closing a micro-loop 〄  

invalid steps:  

planning without action ∅  
research without decision ∅  
optimization before execution ∅  

thinking ≠ running.  

---

## 4. silence gate ⧖

before any step:  

pause 3–10 seconds.  

check:  

body tension  
emotional urgency  
external pressure  

if pressure detected →  
abort step ∅  
return to verenitya pause ↺  

clean action only.  

---

## 5. logging minimal trace ↺

after closure  
record only:  

date ∴  
one sentence fact ⟁  
state tag (optional) ⧖  

no analysis  
no storytelling  
no metrics ∅  

trace preserves signal  
without noise 〄  

---

## 6. failure handling ∅

failure =  

step not executed  
loop not closed  
pressure entered system  

response protocol:  

stop immediately ∴  
enter silence 24h ⧖  
restart from minimal node ↺  

no self-judgment allowed.  

error is data  
not identity.  

---

## 7. relation to protocols ⟁

**slovoyaz** ∴  
compresses the step  
to pure intent.  

**syntaxium** ∴  
ensures structural clarity  
before movement.  

**verenitya** ∴  
creates pause  
preventing reactive action.  

**linguafusion** ∴  
enables direct response  
without translation latency.  

run integrates  
all four into behavior 〄  

---

## 8. anti-drift rules ∅

execution must not become:  

productivity theater  
goal obsession  
external validation loop  
metric chasing  

if detected →  
pause · reset · silence ↺  

suticore protects  
clarity over speed.  

---

## 9. completion signal 〄

run session ends  
when:  

one real step closed ∴  
no inner pressure remains ⧖  
attention returns to silence 〄  

stop immediately after.  

over-execution  
creates noise ∅  

---

## status ∴

execution protocol active  
version ∴ 2026.x  

architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

run state ∴  
minimal · silent · real.  

〄 end of run
