# decision stack ∴ operational algorithm

algorithm of interaction.  
from impulse  
to crystalline action ⟁  

noise reduced  
through structural gates ∅  

---

## 0. execution sequence 〄

stack runs  
as linear  
non-leaking flow:  

∴ node  
locate center.  

⧖ friction  
measure resistance.  

⟁ step  
issue one action.  

〄 closure  
seal the loop.  

order violation →  
semantic leak ∅  

---

## 1. step 1 · ∴ node ⟁

objective ∴  
identify center of mass.  

isolate primary intent.  
remove context  
and “why” ∅  

define single  
point of change.  

if node absent ∴  
∅ remain in silence.  

clarity threshold  
precedes motion ⧖  

---

## 2. step 2 · ⧖ friction ⧖

objective ∴  
regulate environment  
and inner state.  

external ∴  
pressure · fomo present?  

internal ∴  
resistance · fear active?  

systemic ∴  
informational noise detected?  

if pressure > 0 ∴  
⧖ pause.  
execution blocked ∅  

resume only  
after stabilization ↺  

---

## 3. step 3 · ⟁ step 〄

objective ∴  
ground intent  
in physical reality.  

translate node  
into concrete action.  

constraints:  

duration ≤ 10 minutes.  
possible immediately ∴  
reversible without debt ↺  

one step ∴  
one change only.  

non-physical step →  
invalid execution ∅  

---

## 4. step 4 · 〄 closure ↺

objective ∴  
stabilize new state.  

execute step 〄  
record observable trace.  

set review anchor  
only if required ⧖  

reset attention ∅  
return to zero point.  

closure prevents  
loop leakage ⟁  

---

## 5. failure protocols ∅

if node blurred ∴  
⧖ wait for crystallization.  

if friction high ∴  
∅ cancel stack.  

if step oversized ∴  
↺ fragment  
until minimal.  

absence of action ∴  
valid stack result.  

silence may equal  
correct execution ⟁  

---

## 6. application fields ↺

content ∴  
what becomes published.  

energy ∴  
where attention flows.  

system ∴  
how protocols evolve.  

same stack applies  
across all layers ∴  

---

## status ∴

active canon  
version ∴ 2026.x  
vessel ∴ bogota node  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

execution stabilized 〄  
loop closed ↺  

end of decision stack
