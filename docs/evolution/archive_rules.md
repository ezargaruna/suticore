no explanation required.  

---

## 3. non-archivable core ⟁

never archive:  

core canon ∴

these define system limits ∴  
removal forbidden ∅

move ∴ never delete first.

prefix ⧖ add yyyy-mm-dd_.  
location ∴ docs/archive/ ∅  

form continuity preserved 〄

## 6. location rules ∅

read-only ∴ limited access.  
no public index ∅ hidden state.

prevents resurfacing noise ∅

↺ return to canon.

## 9. deletion rule ∅

hard delete permitted when:  

redundancy ∅ canon duplicated.  
corruption ∅ unrecoverable error.  
privacy ∅ risk detected.  

deletion occurs silently ∴  
no historical trace required.

## 10. fatigue protection ⧖

if archiving feels heavy:  

stop immediately ∅  
archive nothing ∅  

revisit next season ⧖  
over-cleaning equals noise ∅  

---

## 11. misuse prevention ⟁

## status ∴

governance layer  
version ∴ 2026.x  
vessel ∴ bogota node  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)
