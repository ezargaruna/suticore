# community_rituals

## purpose
- support shared presence
- reduce isolation
- preserve quiet field

this is not a community strategy.  
this is a shared pause.

---

## core principle
- community is optional
- silence is participation
- absence is valid presence

no engagement goals.  
no growth targets.

---

## ritual definition
a ritual is:
- time-bounded
- low-frequency
- form-driven
- outcome-free

a ritual is not:
- an event
- a campaign
- a discussion thread
- a learning session

---

## allowed ritual types

### shared pause
- same time window
- no coordination talk
- no reporting

example:
- 10 minutes silence
- once per month

---

### quiet prompt
- one short question
- no answers required
- reflection only

example:
- “what can be removed?”

---

### single-step echo
- one step ⟁ shared
- no commentary
- no validation

example:
- “i archived one file.”

---

### seasonal mark
- one symbol
- one line
- no explanation

example:
- ∴ transition

---

## forbidden formats
- live chats
- debates
- feedback rounds
- coaching calls
- accountability groups

interaction pressure  
destroys the field.

---

## participation rules
- no obligation
- no replies expected
- no follow-ups

read-only is valid.  
lurking is valid.

---

## moderation posture
- minimal
- non-reactive
- form-first

remove:
- urgency
- persuasion
- emotional escalation

do not explain removal.

---

## signal reading
valid signals:
- silent returns
- long gaps with reappearance
- reuse without mention

invalid signals:
- activity spikes
- message counts
- reaction volume

---

## fatigue protection
if rituals feel heavy:
- stop all rituals
- keep archive only
- resume next season or never

ending is allowed.

---

## relation to system
- rituals never change canon
- rituals never generate content
- rituals never demand response

canon leads.  
community follows or rests.

---

## scope
applies to:
- telegram @sreteniya
- public comments
- shared documents

private spaces may diverge.

---

## status
- community layer
- optional
- active canon
- version: 2026.2
