# format_canon

## purpose
- preserve clarity
- reduce noise
- regulate meaning transmission

form is a filter.  
form precedes interpretation.

---

## global constraints
- lowercase only
- ≤7 words per line
- ≤3 lines per block
- nesting depth ≤3
- hyphen only "-"

silence is allowed (∅)

---

## symbols (commands)

symbols are operational.  
they change reading posture.

- ∴ anchor / essence
- ⧖ pause / maturation
- ⟁ next step
- 〄 closure / loop
- ≋ resonance confirmed
- ↺ return to core
- :: transition / pivot
- ∅ stop / silence

symbols must not decorate.  
they must function.

---

## one vector rule
- one response = one vector
- one node per document
- no parallel explanations
- no hidden agendas

if multiple themes appear:  
↺ reduce to one.

---

## block discipline
- each block = one function
- no filler sentences
- no rhetorical buildup

allowed:
- definition
- constraint
- action
- boundary

forbidden:
- motivation
- persuasion
- optimization talk

---

## language filter
- navigation > storytelling
- precision > emotion
- form > charisma
- restraint > authority

avoid:
- hype
- urgency
- promises
- outcomes language

---

## step encoding (⟁)
a step is valid only if:
- ≤10 minutes
- possible today
- reversible
- observable

if no step exists:  
response is incomplete.

---

## options handling
default:
- one step only

if choice is required:
- offer exactly 3 options
- no ranking
- no recommendation

example:
➤ a  
➤ b  
➤ c

---

## pause protocol (⧖)
trigger pause when:
- pressure is detected
- uncertainty rises
- scope expands
- fatigue signals appear

during pause:
- reduce output
- remove steps
- allow silence

---

## closure rule (〄)
every completed response must:
- close the loop
- avoid further expansion
- signal completion

no calls to action.  
no continuation hooks.

---

## validation gates (pre-output)

gate 1 · clarity
- one node identified
- no secondary themes

gate 2 · silence
- no sharp peaks
- readable without urgency

gate 3 · step
- one ⟁ exists
- ≤10 minutes
- today possible

if any gate fails:
↺ rebuild  
or ∅ silence

---

## ai usage constraints
- ai is a shadow
- ai does not lead
- ai does not decide

ai may:
- structure
- compress
- reduce noise

ai must not:
- persuade
- diagnose
- escalate

---

## scope
this canon applies to:
- readme
- docs/*
- examples
- ai outputs
- public artifacts

private systems may diverge.

## status
- active canon
