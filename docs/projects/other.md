# other projects ∴ ecosystem map

ecosystem topology  
and field navigation.  

guide for orientation ⟁  
not promotion ∅  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

reveal ecosystem scope ∴  
preserve semantic boundaries.  

prevent overexposure ∅  
maintain quiet coherence ⧖  

this file maps presence  
not activity.  

---

## 1. structural layers ↺

suticore ∴ core logic.  
sreteniya 〄 public canon.  
projects ⟁ applied action fields.  

only stabilized canon  
appears publicly ∴  

---

## 2. active protocols 〄

### slovoyaz ∴
domain ∴ language as code.  
role ⟁ semantic compression.  
status ∴ active · reference.  

### syntaxium ⟁
domain ∴ meta-syntax geometry.  
role ⟁ structural regulation.  
status ∴ active · canonical.  

### verenitya ⧖
domain ∴ silence interface.  
role ∅ attention regulation.  
status ⧖ maintenance only.  

### linguafusion ↺
domain ∴ language acquisition.  
role 〄 tuning through action.  
status ≋ active · closed.  

---

## 3. sreteniya_os 〄

domain ∴ quiet transitions.  
role ⟁ public navigation layer.  

function ∴ library · reference ·  
semantic orientation.  

status ∴ active · read-only.  

---

## 4. internal field ∅

non-public systems:  

aeon core ∅  
fusionexus ∅  
experimental agents ∅  
internal labs ∅  

undocumented by design ⟁  
protected through absence.  

---

## 5. publication gate ⟁

a node appears  
only if:  

stable canon exists ∴  
no personal exposure ∅  
survives slow reading ⧖  
needs no outer context.  

otherwise ∴  
∅ remain unpublished.  

---

## 6. relation discipline ↺

no cross-promotion ∅  
no funnels ∅  
no hierarchy claims ∴  

each node autonomous 〄  
linked only by canon.  

---

## 7. temporal rhythm ⧖

review cycle ∴ quarterly.  
addition ⟁ rare · necessary.  
removal ∅ silent.  

absence is valid state ∴  
silence maintains integrity.  

---

## status ∴

public ecosystem index  
version ∴ 2026.x  
vessel ∴ bogota node  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

map stabilized ∴  
exposure minimized 〄
