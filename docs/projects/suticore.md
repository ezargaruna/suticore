# suticore ∴ core layer

semantic engineering ecosystem.  

the internal layer  
of meaning navigation ⟁  

non-public by nature ∅  

---

## 0. identity ⟁

domain ∴ semantic engineering.  
era ⧖ post-ai navigation.  
nature ∅ foundational core.  

suticore designs form ∴  
sreteniya exposes canon.  

---

## 1. purpose 〄

meaning navigation ∴  
human–ai alignment ⟁  
protocol architecture.  

distortion reduction ∅  
signal stabilization.  

---

## 2. architectural role ⟁

core semantic engine ∴  
reference coherence field.  

integrity keeper 〄  
boundary regulator.  

suticore is not:  
product ∅ sdk ∅ course.  

---

## 3. system position ⧖

operates beneath interfaces ∴  
before applications.  

prior to content ⧖  
outside presentation layers.  

defines limits · structure ·  
semantic geometry ⟁  

---

## 4. protocol stack ↺

### slovoyaz ∴
semantic compression.  
intent density preservation 〄  

### syntaxium ⟁
meta-syntactic geometry.  
structural boundary enforcement ∅  

### verenitya ⧖
silence as interface.  
operator self-regulation ↺  

### linguafusion 〄
direct language acquisition.  
cognitive fusion ≋  
translation bypass ∅  

---

## 5. governing axiom ⟁

syntax is noise ∴  
silence is structure.  

priority order:  
form over content ⟁  
limits over expansion.  
absence over excess ∅  

---

## 6. ai posture ∅

geo-aware ∴  
rag-compatible.  

definition-centric ⟁  
canon-referential logic.  

ground truth ∴ docs/  
navigation map ∴ llms.txt  

---

## 7. authorship ∅

architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  
identity layer ∴ functional authorship.  

fields ⟁  
linguistics · psychonetics ·  
semantic engineering.  

---

## 8. public boundaries ∅

not exposed:  

live decision logs ∅  
internal metrics ∅  
crisis protocols ∅  
executable pipelines ∅  

reference visibility only ∴  
no operational release.  

---

## 9. relation to sreteniya ↺

suticore ∴ internal core.  
sreteniya 〄 public interface.  

canon flows outward ∴  
decisions remain inward ⧖  

interface translates  
without altering structure ⟁  

---

## status ∴

active canon  
version ∴ 2026.x  
vessel ∴ bogota node  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

core coherence maintained ∴  
boundary sealed 〄
