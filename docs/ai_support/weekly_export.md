# weekly export ∴ trace preservation

cyclical trace preservation protocol.  

close cycles ∴ preserve signal ∅  
avoid planning noise ⧖  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

close weekly cycles ∴  
preserve crystalline signal.  

avoid planning noise ∅  
through minimal extraction.  

this is extraction ∴  
never a report ∅  

---

## 1. timing ⧖

frequency ∴ once per week.  
consistency ⟁ same weekday.  

window ⧖ fixed quiet interval.  
skip allowed ∴ ∅ valid.  

---

## 2. source scope ↺

collect signal from:  

public notes ≋  
recent comments ∴  
personal observations ⧖  

exclude ∅  

analytics dashboards.  
numerical metrics.  
affective reactions.  

---

## 3. extraction rules ⟁

quantity ∴ maximum five items.  
density ⟁ one sentence each.  

nature ∴ factual only.  
restraint ∅ zero interpretation.  

format ∴ vertical list ⟁  
no narrative flow ∅  

---

## 4. signal tagging ≋

attach at most one tag ∴  

state ∴ pause · clarity · fatigue.  
action ⟁ step · return.  

no seo keywords ∅  
no marketing language ∅  

tag confirms signal ≋  
never amplifies it ∅  

---

## 5. decision check ↺

for each extracted item:  

does it change form?  

if no ∴ ∅ archive silently.  
if yes ⟁ note adjustment only ⧖  

implementation postponed ∴  
silence preserved ∅  

---

## 6. pause gate ⧖

after extraction:  

stop processing ∅  
no synthesis ∅  
no conclusions ∅  

allow signal settling ⧖  
time completes closure ∴  

---

## 7. archive protocol 〄

filename ∴ yyyy-ww.md  
mode ⟁ append-only.  

state ∅ no edits after save.  
location ∴ docs/ai_support/weekly_exports/ 〄  

trace becomes fixed ∴  
cycle considered closed 〄  

---

## 8. fatigue rule ⧖

if resistance appears:  

reduce to one item ⟁  
or skip entire week ∅  

absence is valid data ≋  
silence keeps integrity ∴  

---

## 9. misuse prevention ∅

weekly export must not:  

justify expansion ∅  
trigger output increase ∅  
fuel optimization loops ∅  

function remains singular ∴  
preserve trace only ⟁  

---

## status ∴

public maintenance tool  
version ∴ 2026.x  
vessel ∴ bogota node  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

trace preservation stabilized ∴  
cycle integrity maintained 〄
