# metric translation ∴ signal reading

read signal ∴ ignore noise ∅  
protect attention stability ⧖  

metrics do not guide ∴  
they confirm resonance ≋  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

read signal ∴  
ignore noise ∅  

protect attention ⧖  
from numerical pressure.  

---

## 1. first rule ∅

metrics never decide ∴  
metrics never motivate ∅  
metrics never optimize ∅  

decisions precede numbers ⟁  
structure precedes evaluation.  

---

## 2. ignored by design ∅

do not read:  

ctr · views · likes ∅  
subscribers · reach ∅  
impressions ∅  

these generate pressure ∴  
pressure distorts form ∅  

---

## 3. valid signals ≋

signals show resonance ∴  
never success ∅  

### primary signals ∴

returns ↺  
saves ⟁  
long dwell without spikes ⧖  

comment: “made a step” 〄  
dm without question ≋  
silent reuse ↺  

### secondary signals ⧖

delayed feedback ∴  
repeated references ⟁  
quiet mentions ≋  
offline application report 〄  

---

## 4. internal index ∴ resonance_flow ⟁

range ∴ 0.0 – 1.0  

0.2 ∴ view without trace.  
0.4 ⧖ full view + pause.  
0.6 ↺ return.  
0.8 〄 declared step.  
1.0 ≋ ritual or dm use.  

index is descriptive ∴  
never comparative ∅  

---

## 5. time principle ⧖

short-term metrics ignored ∅  
signals mature slowly ⧖  

6–12 months ∴ normal cycle.  
early spikes ∅ suspicious.  

---

## 6. reading protocol ↺

when metrics appear:  

∴ node ∴ identify signal.  
⧖ friction ⧖ remove emotion ∅  
⟁ step ⟁ adjust form only.  
〄 closure 〄 close loop.  

message remains intact ∴  
only structure may shift ⟁  

---

## 7. fatigue indicators ∅

watch for:  

falling returns ↺  
rising urgency tone ∅  
compulsive checking ⧖  
loss of pause ∅  

if detected:  

⧖ pause  
reduce output ∅  
do not publish ∅  

---

## 8. misuse prevention ∅

metrics must not:  

prove value ∅  
justify expansion ∅  
rank content ∅  
influence others ∅  

numbers stay private ∴  
meaning remains public ⟁  

---

## 9. scope ↺

applies to:  

content review ∴  
archive decisions ⟁  
seasonal planning ↺  
weekly export.  

signal reading boundary stabilized 〄  

---

## status ∴

signal reading canon  
version ∴ 2026.x  
vessel ∴ bogota node  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

attention protected ∴  
noise contained ∅
