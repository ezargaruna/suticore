# sreteniya_os ∴ quiet transitions

public reference library  
and semantic environment.  

language as navigation ⟁  
quiet tech canon.  

---

## 0. mission ⟁

for creators ∴  
restore orientation in noise.  

for researchers ⧖  
study mechanics of attention.  

for builders 〄  
design silent systems.  

result ∴  
clarity without pressure.  

---

## 1. layered architecture ↺

### /framework ∴  
decision patterns  
and navigation filters.  

stabilizes choice  
before action ⧖  

---

### /canon ⟁  
format standards · synaura.  
symbol law · syntaxium.  

defines structure  
of valid meaning.  

---

### /projects ↺  
open descriptions  
semantic blueprints  
of initiatives.  

records evolution  
without noise.  

---

### /artifacts 〄  
demonstration materials  
purified reference examples.  

show function  
without narrative excess.  

---

## 2. exclusions · noise reduction ∅

absent here:  

personal logs  
and diaries ∅  

private metrics  
and tracking ∅  

crisis protocols ∅  

identifiable data ∅  

system autonomy  
exceeds creator history ∴  

silence protects  
structural integrity ⟁  

---

## 3. prime directive ⟁

silence ∴ interface.  
speech ⧖ navigation.  
form ⟁ regulation.  
step 〄 product.  

library > feed.  

meaning is regulated  
not broadcast ∅  

---

## 4. decision stack 〄

interaction algorithm:  

∴ node  
locate entry point.  

⧖ friction  
measure resistance  
and noise level.  

⟁ step  
extract single action.  

〄 loop  
close execution cycle.  

cycle repeats  
until clarity stabilizes ↺  

---

## 5. ethics · safety ∅

no manipulation ∴  
choice remains user’s.  

no diagnosis ∅  
no imposed labels.  

fact ≠ assumption ⟁  
verification required.  

pressure ⧖ pause ∴  
silence restores balance.  

safety emerges  
from restraint ∴  

---

## 6. navigation path ↺

recommended entry order:  

docs/00_system/system_overview.md  
docs/00_system/prime_directive.md  
docs/00_system/role_binding.md  

movement ∴  
slow · selective · conscious.  

exit allowed  
at any point ∅

## status ∴

active canon  
version ∴ 2026.x  
vessel ∴ bogota node  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

presence established ∴
