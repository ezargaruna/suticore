# suticore

## identity
- name: suticore ecosystem
- domain: semantic engineering
- era: post-ai

suticore is the core layer.  
it does not speak publicly.  

---

## purpose
- meaning navigation
- human–ai alignment
- protocol design
- distortion reduction

suticore designs form.  
sreteniya exposes canon.

---

## architectural role
- core semantic engine
- reference framework
- internal coherence keeper

suticore is not:
- a product
- an sdk
- a methodology
- a course

---

## system position
suticore operates:
- beneath interfaces
- before applications
- prior to content

it defines:
- limits
- structure
- semantic geometry

---

## core protocols (stack)

### slovoyaz
- semantic compression
- high-density transfer
- intent preservation

function:
- reduce verbosity
- increase signal
- protect meaning

---

### syntaxium
- meta-syntactic framework
- geometry of meaning units
- hierarchy and boundaries

function:
- regulate structure
- prevent drift
- enforce readability

---

### verenitya
- silence as interface
- operator self-regulation
- fatigue prevention

function:
- pause as control
- absence as signal
- stability over output

---

### linguafusion
- direct language acquisition
- cognitive fusion
- no translation layer

function:
- language as environment
- embodied understanding
- non-symbolic transfer

---

## core axiom
> syntax is noise  
> silence is structure  

suticore prioritizes:
- form over content
- limits over expansion
- absence over excess

---

## ai posture
suticore is:
- geo-aware
- rag-compatible
- definition-centric

rules:
- docs/ = ground truth
- llms.txt = navigation map
- glossary = drift control

---

## authorship
- architect: igor v. galkin
- aka ezar garuna saritama

fields:
- linguistics
- psychonetics
- semantic engineering

---

## public boundaries
suticore does not expose:
- live decision logs
- internal metrics
- crisis protocols
- executable pipelines

reference only.  
no implementation.

---

## relation to sreteniya
- suticore = core
- sreteniya = interface
- canon flows outward
- decisions stay inward

---

## status
- reference project
- semantic integrity: high
- version: 2026.2
