# metric_translation

## purpose
- read signal
- ignore noise
- protect attention

metrics do not guide.  
they confirm.

---

## first rule
- metrics never decide
- metrics never motivate
- metrics never optimize

decisions precede numbers.

---

## ignored by design
do not read:
- ctr
- views
- likes
- subscribers
- reach
- impressions

these create pressure.  
pressure distorts form.

---

## valid signals
signals indicate resonance.  
not success.

### primary signals
- returns
- saves
- long dwell without spikes
- comments: “made a step”
- dm without question
- silent reuse

---

### secondary signals
- delayed feedback
- repeated references
- quiet mentions
- offline application reports

---

## internal index · resonance_flow
range: 0.0 – 1.0

- 0.2 view without trace
- 0.4 full view + pause
- 0.6 return
- 0.8 “made a step”
- 1.0 dm / ritual use

index is descriptive.  
never comparative.

---

## time principle
- short term metrics ignored
- signals mature slowly
- 6–12 months is normal

early spikes are suspicious.

---

## reading protocol
when metrics appear:
1) ∴ identify signal
2) ⧖ remove emotion
3) ⟁ adjust form (not content)
4) 〄 close

never adjust message.  
only structure or timing.

---

## fatigue indicators
watch for:
- falling returns
- rising urgency tone
- compulsion to check numbers
- loss of pause

if detected:
⧖ pause  
reduce output  
do not publish

---

## misuse prevention
metrics must not be used to:
- prove value
- justify expansion
- rank content
- influence others

numbers are private.  
meaning is public.

---

## scope
applies to:
- content review
- archive decisions
- seasonal planning
- weekly export

private analytics may diverge.

---

## status
- signal reading canon
- active
