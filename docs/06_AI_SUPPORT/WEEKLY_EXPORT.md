# weekly_export

## purpose
- close cycles
- preserve signal
- avoid planning noise

this is an extraction.  
not a report.

---

## timing
- once per week
- same weekday
- fixed quiet window

skip is allowed.

---

## source scope
collect from:
- public notes
- comments (if any)
- personal observations

exclude:
- analytics dashboards
- raw metrics
- emotional summaries

---

## extraction rules
- max 5 items
- one sentence per item
- factual only
- no interpretation

format:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

---

## signal tagging (optional)
attach at most one:
- state:pause
- state:clarity
- state:fatigue
- action:step
- action:return

no seo tags.

---

## decision check
for each item ask:
- does it change form?

if no:
- archive silently

if yes:
- note adjustment
- do not implement yet

---

## ⧖ pause gate
after extraction:
- stop processing
- no synthesis
- no conclusions

let signal settle.

---

## archive
store as:
- YYYY-WW.md
- append-only
- no edits after save

location:
- docs/06_AI_SUPPORT/weekly_exports/

---

## fatigue rule
if resistance appears:
- reduce to 1 item
- or ∅ skip week

absence is valid data.

---

## misuse prevention
weekly export must not:
- justify expansion
- trigger output increase
- fuel optimization

it only preserves trace.

---

## scope
applies to:
- public maintenance
- archive hygiene
- seasonal review input

private layers may diverge.

---

## status
- public maintenance tool
- active canon
- version: 2026.2
