# archive_rules

## purpose
- preserve clarity
- reduce accumulation
- keep library alive

archive is not storage.  
archive is a boundary.

---

## core principle
- everything published is temporary
- value decays without context
- removal is maintenance

keeping is a decision.  
removing is also a decision.

---

## what gets archived
archive content when:
- signal is exhausted
- form no longer holds
- repetition appears
- fatigue markers rise
- context is lost

archive without explanation.

---

## what never gets archived
do not archive:
- core canon
- format rules
- symbolic reference
- boundary documents

these define identity.  
they remain stable.

---

## archive timing
- no fixed schedule
- decision by signal
- minimum interval: 30 days

never archive impulsively.

---

## archive method
when archiving:
- move, do not delete
- keep filename
- add date prefix

format:
`YYYY-MM-DD_filename.md`

---

## archive location
- docs/archive/
- read-only
- no index by default

absence of index  
prevents resurfacing.

---

## annotation rules
optional:
- one-line note
- factual only
- no justification

example:
`archived: signal exhausted`

---

## retrieval rule
retrieval is allowed only if:
- context fully changed
- form still valid
- no pressure involved

otherwise:
↺ return to canon  
∅ leave archived

---

## deletion rule
hard delete allowed when:
- content duplicates canon
- errors cannot be corrected
- privacy risk appears

deletion is silent.

---

## fatigue protection
if archiving feels heavy:
- stop immediately
- archive nothing
- revisit later

over-cleaning is also noise.

---

## misuse prevention
archive must not be used to:
- rewrite history
- hide mistakes
- curate image
- optimize perception

archive serves clarity.  
not reputation.

---

## scope
applies to:
- docs/*
- examples
- weekly exports
- public notes

private layers may diverge.

---

## status
- archive canon
- active
- version: 2026.2
