# validation gates ∴ quality control

filters of semantic integrity.  

prevent noise ∅  
stop premature output.  

no gate →  
no output ∅

## 0. purpose ⟁

prevent semantic noise ∅  
stop premature crystallization.

question ∴  
is there one step?  

checks ⟁  
exactly one action.  
possible today ∴  
reversible ↺

if fail ∴  
↺ rebuild  
or ∅ silence.

## 4. gate 4 · 〄 integrity

question ∴  
is form preserved?  

checks 〄  
synaura respected.  
symbols functional ⟁  

fail ∅  
long lines.  
decorative glyphs.  
semantic noise.  

if fail ∴  
↺ reformat  
until stable.

## 6. escalation rule ∅

if more than  
one gate fails:  

stop processing  
immediately ∅  

no rewrite attempt.  

silence becomes  
only valid output ∴

## 7. review posture ⧖

slow ⧖  
non-reactive.

gates apply to:  

public documents.

same control logic  
across all layers ↺
