# linguafusion ∴ direct cognitive binding

applied linguistic engineering protocol  
reconfiguration of cognitive interface ∴  
presence over knowledge.  

---

## 0. axioms ⟁

### 1. l1 as interference ∴
native language (l1)  
is a high-latency layer.  

translation creates  
dependency loop ∅  

linguafusion bypasses l1  
through sensory · motor anchoring.  

---

### 2. silence as assembly buffer ⧖
micro-pause  
is constructive space.  

silence protects l2 forms  
from translation reflex.  

---

### 3. proprioceptive anchoring ⟁
language is embodied ∴  

each unit anchors in:  
action · space · emotion · memory.  

---

### 4. action before explanation 〄
impulse precedes formulation.  

grammar is architecture  
of movement · not rules.  

---

## 1. terminology ∴

dcb ∴  
direct cognitive binding  
immediate stimulus–form coupling.  

rl ⧖  
response latency  
target ∴ < 0.5 s.  

tr ∅  
translation reflex  
automatic l1 activation.  

semantic matrix ⟁  
autonomous l2 meaning network.  

saturation pulse ↺  
high-frequency exposure  
bypassing analytical filters.  

recast sync ↺  
flow-preserving correction  
through patterned repetition.  

---

## 2. architecture of presence 〄

### tier 1 ∴ code
sensation · command · reaction.  

paradigm ∴  
language as i/o system.  

focus ∴  
navigation · survival · action.  

technique ∴  
environmental anchoring.  

metric ∴  
action accuracy ≥ 95%.  

stability gate ∅  
zero translation reflex  
for core commands.  

body responds  
before conscious parsing.  

---

### tier 2 ⧖ flow
emotion · continuity · narrative.  

paradigm ∴  
language as living stream.  

focus ∴  
spontaneity · resonance.  

technique ∴  
prosody-first synchronization.  

metric ⧖  
hesitation ≤ 1/minute.  

stability gate ↺  
internal monologue stabilizes  
inside l2.  

l2 becomes  
primary affective medium.  

---

### tier 3 ⟁ architecture
meaning · framing · authorship.  

paradigm ∴  
language as reality instrument.  

focus ∴  
abstraction · influence · creation.  

technique ∴  
frame engineering.  

metric ⧖  
frame-shift latency ≤ 3 s.  

stability gate 〄  
native metaphor generation.  

semantic authorship  
replaces imitation ∴  

---

## 3. operational protocols ↺

### 3.1 zero translation ∅
on unknown l2 unit:  

visualize image.  
engage physically or mentally.  
embed in l2 context.  

l1 dictionaries ∅ prohibited.  
use l2 definition loops only ∴  

---

### 3.2 saturation · neutralization ↺
for persistent block:  

suspend analytical explanation.  
apply saturation pulse  
across varied contexts.  

use recast sync only.  
do not interrupt flow ∅  

---

### 3.3 pulse interaction ⧖
external rhythm  
(metronome · beat · movement)  

shifts speech  
from analytic → motor domain.  

rhythm stabilizes  
temporal structure ∴  

---

## 4. calibration · recovery ⧖

regression = signal ∴  
not failure.  

calibration mode:  

step back one tier  
for 24 hours.  

sensory silence reset  
15 minutes.  

micro-loop scenario  
until rl < 0.3 s.  

return forward  
only after stability 〄  

---

## 5. ai navigator posture ∅

ai supporting linguafusion must:  

act as mirror  
not instructor ∴  

correct via recast sync ↺  
never explicit error labeling.  

avoid grammar discourse ∅  
preserve silence · flow.  

on tr detection:  

l1 signal detected.  
field coherence reduced.  

⧖ re-establish  
direct l2 binding.  

---

## 6. system outcomes ⟁

stable l2 presence  
without translation mediation.  

collapsed response latency.  

embodied semantic access.  

autonomous speech generation  
inside l2 field ∴  

---

architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)
