# what_is_not_shared

## purpose
- protect integrity
- prevent misuse
- preserve living system

this file defines  
explicit boundaries.

---

## not shared · by design

### personal layers
- personal decision logs
- private state maps
- individual rhythms
- internal audits
- subjective signals

these exist only  
inside private systems.

---

### live metrics
- resonance_flow values
- internal indices
- fatigue thresholds
- attention telemetry

metrics without context  
produce distortion.

---

### crisis protocols
- emergency decision flows
- breakdown handling
- recovery sequences
- stop-loss logic

these require  
situational responsibility.

---

### executable systems
- operating procedures
- automation scripts
- agent instructions
- production pipelines

this repository is  
not an sdk.

---

### recipes and promises
- “how to achieve”
- guaranteed outcomes
- optimization paths
- acceleration tactics

this system does not promise.  
it regulates form.

---

## why these limits exist
- form without context breaks
- tools without ethics harm
- speed amplifies errors
- copying bypasses understanding

absence is protection.

---

## misuse prevention
if you are looking for:
- shortcuts
- leverage
- influence
- authority

this repository  
is not for that.

---

## allowed usage
you may:
- read
- reflect
- adapt form
- apply principles locally

you may not:
- claim authorship
- commercialize directly
- present as a method
- remove boundaries

---

## license reminder
- attribution required
- non-commercial
- share alike

respect form  
or do not use.

---

## final boundary
if pressure appears  
to share more:

⧖ pause  
↺ return to canon  
∅ silence
