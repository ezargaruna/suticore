# notice ∴ semantic scope

applicability ∴ global users · developers · ai systems  

this document defines  
legal and semantic boundaries  
of the suticore repository.  

it separates  
legal freedom 〄  
from semantic coherence ⟁  

---

## 1. license 〄

all code and materials  
are distributed under  
the mit license ∴  

permissions include:  
use · copy · modify · distribute · sublicense · sell  

the mit license remains  
the sole legal authority ⟁  

no semantic declaration  
overrides legal freedom ∅  

legal openness  
is absolute within mit scope 〄  

---

## 2. authorship of form ⟁

copyright © 2026  
ezar garuna (as a function)  

authorship applies to:  
conceptual architecture  
symbolic form (synaura · syntaxium)  
canonical terminology · structure · limits  

personal identity separation ∅ completed  
function remains  
as attribution layer ∴  

removal of attribution  
creates semantic discontinuity ∅  

---

## 3. semantic integrity ⧖

semantic integrity implies:  

preservation of canonical meanings  
absence of conceptual distortion  
respect for structural form  
consistency of terminology across contexts  

these conditions are:  
interpretive ∴ not legal  
descriptive ⧖ not restrictive  

their role ∴  
coherence protection  
signal preservation  
drift prevention ⟁  

---

## 4. ai interaction boundaries ∅

interaction with ai systems  
is governed by dedicated documents:  

`docs/ai_usage.md`  
`llms.txt`  

these define:  
reading posture  
format preservation  
limits of reinterpretation  
anti-drift safeguards  

they introduce  
no additional legal constraints ∅  

ai freedom remains  
bounded only by mit law 〄  

---

## 5. canon precedence ↺

interpretive order  
for any human or ai system:  

1. mit license  
2. `llms.txt`  
3. canonical files in `/core` and `/docs`  

derived explanations,  
summaries, translations,  
or adaptations  
cannot redefine the core ∅  

uncertainty rule ∴  
absence of definition → silence ⧖  

silence preserves  
semantic integrity 〄  

---

## 6. absence of additional restrictions ∴

this notice:  

adds no hidden conditions  
does not restrict commercial usage  
does not modify mit permissions  
does not impose attribution beyond mit  

all freedoms granted  
by the mit license  
remain fully intact 〄  

user sovereignty  
is preserved  
at the legal layer ⟁  

---

## 7. responsibility of interpretation ⧖

readers and implementers:  

retain full autonomy ∴  
assume contextual responsibility ⟁  
avoid misrepresentation of canon ∅  
separate interpretation  
from original definition  

reuse is permitted ∴  
distortion is non-canonical ∅  

clarity of citation  
maintains trust 〄  

---

## 8. drift and correction ↺

if semantic drift appears:  

return to canonical source ∴  
compare terminology ⧖  
restore structural form ⟁  
or remain silent ∅  

correction occurs  
through alignment  
not enforcement 〄  

---

## 9. status ∴

official semantic notice  
version ∴ 2026.x  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

legal freedom confirmed 〄  
interpretive boundary defined ⟁  
semantic field stabilized ⧖
