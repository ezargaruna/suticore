## 4. ai interaction boundaries ∅

interaction with ai systems  
is governed by dedicated documents:  

`docs/ai_usage.md`  
`llms.txt`  

these define posture of reading,  
format preservation,  
and limits of reinterpretation ∴  

they introduce  
no additional legal constraints ∅  

---

## 5. canon precedence ↺

interpretive order for any system:  

1. mit license  
2. `llms.txt`  
3. canonical files in `/core` and `/docs`  

derived explanations,  
summaries, or adaptations  
cannot redefine the core ∅

absence of definition → silence ⧖
