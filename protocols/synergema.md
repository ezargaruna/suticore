# synergema ∴

universal protocol  
for crystallizing essence  
of project · human · group · business ⟁  

synergema =  
structured convergence  
of meaning · function · direction 〄  

not branding ∅  
not positioning ∅  
but ontological fixation of core ∴  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

reveal irreducible essence ∴  

remove semantic noise ∅  

align intent → structure → action 〄  

essence once fixed  
becomes navigation field ↺  

---

## 1. definition ⧖

synergema ∴  
minimal complete formula  
that simultaneously expresses:  

identity ⟁  
function ⧖  
direction 〄  

if any element missing ∴  
synergema unstable ∅  

---

## 2. application scope ↺

individual ∴ vocation core.  
project ⧖ mission vector.  
team ⟁ collective function.  
business 〄 value engine.  

same algorithm ∴  
different scale only.  

---

## 3. structural model ⟁

synergema contains  
four invariant layers:  

### 3.1 essence ∴

what cannot be removed  
without loss of identity.  

test ⧖  
if removed → system dissolves ∅  

format ∴  
one sentence maximum.  

---

### 3.2 function ⧖

what transformation  
is produced in reality.  

input → process → output 〄  

must be observable ∴  
not conceptual ∅  

---

### 3.3 vector ⟁

direction of evolution  
across time.  

answers:  
toward what state  
the system moves ∴  

vector without time  
= static structure ∅  

---

### 3.4 boundary 〄

what the system  
explicitly is not.  

removal of чуждое  
protects integrity ∅  

clarity grows  
through exclusion ∴  

---

## 4. extraction algorithm ↺

### step 1 ∴ noise purge

remove:  
roles · titles · markets · trends ∅  

leave only  
lived signal of activity ⧖  

---

### step 2 ⧖ invariant detection

find patterns  
repeating across years.  

stable under crisis?  
stable under success?  

if yes → candidate essence ⟁  

---

### step 3 ⟁ compression

reduce description  
until only irreducible core remains.  

rule ∴  
≤ 12 words.  

if meaning lost →  
compression excessive ∅  

---

### step 4 〄 verification

essence must satisfy:  

clarity ∴ instantly understood.  
truth ⧖ resonates internally.  
stability ⟁ unchanged by context.  
energy 〄 generates action.  

failure of any →  
return to step 2 ↺  

---

## 5. synergema formula ∴

final structure expressed as:  

**X exists to Y  
through Z  
toward W.**  

where:  

X ∴ identity.  
Y ⧖ function.  
Z ⟁ method.  
W 〄 vector.  

minimal ∴ complete.  

---

## 6. density calibration ⧖

low density ∴  
for humans · personal path.  

standard ⟁  
for teams · projects.  

high density 〄  
for ecosystems · doctrines.  

clarity priority  
over poetic compression ∴  

---

## 7. collective synthesis protocol ⟁

for group or business:  

1 ∴ extract personal essences.  
2 ⧖ find overlapping invariant.  
3 ⟁ remove contradictions.  
4 〄 fix shared vector.  

result ∴  
collective synergema  
stronger than individuals ↺  

---

## 8. failure patterns ∅

marketing language ∅  
role descriptions ∅  
future fantasies ∅  
borrowed missions ∅  

if persuasion appears →  
essence false ∅  

---

## 9. activation 〄

once synergema fixed:  

use as decision filter ∴  
use as hiring criterion ⟁  
use as product compass ⧖  
use as narrative core 〄  

any action  
contradicting synergema →  
structural drift ∅  

---

## 10. evolution rule ↺

true essence  
changes rarely.  

review interval ∴  
3–5 years.  

change allowed only  
after irreversible transformation 〄  

else ∴  
preserve original core.  

---

version ∴ 2026.x  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)
