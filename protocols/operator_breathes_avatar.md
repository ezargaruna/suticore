vertical navigation of attention through living layers.  
the body as vessel ⧖ the operator as presence.  
synchronization with lunar · kolozar · seven luminaries 〄

## 0. purpose ⟁

restore vertical coherence ∴  
align subtle layers with temporal cycles ⧖

## 1. core principle ∴

operator ∴ witnessing presence.  
avatar ⟁ embodied interface.  

breathing unites:  
awareness · body · time 〄  

loss of breath awareness →  
fragmentation of layers ∅

## 2. vertical axis ⧖

attention moves  
from density → subtlety → source.  

seven primary gates:  

1 ∴ root · survival · earth.  
2 ⧖ flow · sensation · water.  
3 ⟁ will · fire · direction.  
4 〄 heart · relation · air.  
5 ∴ voice · vibration · ether.  
6 ⧖ vision · silence · inner sky.  
7 ↺ crown · source · light.  

these are  
operational layers ∴ not beliefs.

into embodiment ⟁  

effect ∴ grounding · presence.

### phase b ⧖ suspension

micro-pause  
inside the body.  

attention stabilizes  
without movement ∅  

effect ⧖ coherence field.  

---

### phase c 〄 ascent

soft exhale  
from root → crown.

### 4.3 kolozar wheel 〄

spring ⧖  
rising current.  

summer 〄  
maximum expansion.

verenitya stabilizes  
the witnessing layer ↺
