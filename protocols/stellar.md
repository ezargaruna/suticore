# stellar archetypes ∴

protocol of perceiving  
zodiacal fields and planets ⧖  
algorithms of silent star-reading 〄  

cosmos is not prediction ∴  
cosmos is orientation ⟁  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

restore symbolic perception ∴  

separate signal  
from superstition ∅  

translate sky motion  
into inner navigation 〄  

astrology here =  
language of cycles ⧖  
not belief system ∅  

---

## 1. three layers of star-reading ↺

### layer i ∴ zodiac field
twelve archetypal environments.  

describe **quality of space**  
not personal fate ∅  

question ∴  
“what kind of field is active?”  

---

### layer ii ⧖ planetary motion
moving operators of change.  

describe **function of energy**  
inside the field.  

question ∴  
“what is acting now?”  

---

### layer iii 〄 house localization
point of manifestation.  

describes **where experience lands**  
in lived reality.  

question ∴  
“where does it unfold?”

## 4. core algorithms of star-reading 〄

### algorithm 1 ∴ field recognition

### algorithm 2 ⧖ operator tracing
locate strongest planetary motion.  

retrograde ↺ = inward turn.  
conjunction 〄 = fusion.  
square ∅ = friction.  
trine ∴ = ease of flow.  

read **process**, not event.  

---

### algorithm 3 ⟁ house grounding

no abstraction without place ∅  

---

### algorithm 4 ↺ temporal humility
future is probabilistic ∴

not outcome ∅
