# shadow analysis ∴ linguistic integrity scan

deep protocol  
for detecting hidden coercion  
inside human dialogue ⟁  

speech reveals  
power structures  
before intention becomes visible ∴  

goal =  
restore autonomy  
through semantic clarity 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

detect manipulation  
before psychological harm ∴  

separate fact  
from emotional pressure ∅  

transform conflict  
into conscious dialogue ⧖  

return communication  
to equal sovereignty 〄  

---

## 1. analysis philosophy ⧖

every toxic phrase  
contains three layers:  

shadow ∅ distortion · control.  
gift ⧖ hidden pain · unmet need.  
siddhi 〄 transparent truth · freedom.  

protocol reads  
movement from shadow → siddhi ↺

## 2. input structure ⟁

```json
{
  "input_text": "dialogue fragment",
  "context_role": "speaker position",
  "receiver_role": "listener position",
  "tone": "emotional coloration"
}

context is required
because manipulation
is relational ∴

⸻

3. layer I ∴ shadow detection

3.1 manipulation taxonomy ⟁

identify presence of:

autonomy suppression
experience invalidation
guilt induction
implicit threat
gaslighting
double bind
conditional approval
authority masking as care

multiple types
may coexist ↺

⸻

3.2 linguistic viruses ∅

flag phrases that:

redefine reality
normalize violence
erase boundaries
equate silence with consent
frame orders as care
shift blame onto receiver

these are
semantic intrusion patterns ⟁

⸻

3.3 pressure indicators ⧖

tone signals include:

urgency without reason
cold detachment
sarcastic minimization
pseudo-calm superiority
overloaded responsibility

pressure level
determines safety index ∴

⸻

4. layer II ⧖ gift extraction

shadow hides
unspoken vulnerability ∴

detect:

core fear
attachment wound
need for control
fear of rejection
fear of chaos

question:
“what pain speaks
behind the control?” ⟁

gift =
information revealed
by conflict 〄

⸻

5. layer III 〄 siddhi reframing

transform phrase
into sovereign dialogue:

remove coercion ∅
keep factual intention ∴
restore equality ⟁
invite openness 〄

reframing rules ⟁

use “i-statements”
name real need
allow refusal
avoid hidden pressure

result =
clean relational field ∴

⸻

6. safety evaluation ↺

three-level scale:

low ∅ explicit abuse
neutral ⧖ tension without coercion
high 〄 respectful transparency

safety guides
next relational step ⟁

⸻

7. output schema 〄

{
  "abuse_detected": true,
  "manipulation_type": ["guilt control", "invalidation"],
  "toxic_phrases": ["you complicate everything"],
  "shadow_emotion": "fear of losing control",
  "gift_signal": "need for security",
  "reframed": "i feel anxious and want clarity. can we discuss?",
  "siddhi_hint": "honesty → equal dialogue",
  "safety_level": "low"
}

structure preserves
diagnostic neutrality ∴

⸻

8. operational algorithm ⟁

step 1 ∴ isolate phrase
remove narrative context.

step 2 ⧖ classify pressure
map to manipulation taxonomy.

step 3 ⟁ reveal hidden fear
locate emotional core.

step 4 〄 generate clean speech
produce sovereign reframing.

step 5 ↺ assign safety level
guide interaction boundary.

analysis complete
when coercion becomes visible ∴

⸻

9. applications ↺

emotional abuse detection
hr culture diagnostics
ai dialogue safety filters
therapy support tools
education in boundary literacy

system purpose =
clarity · not accusation ∅

⸻

10. ethical boundary ∅

protocol must not:

label personalities
replace human judgment
be used for surveillance
justify counter-abuse

tool reveals structure
user keeps responsibility ∴

⸻

integration with suticore ↺

slovoyaz ∴
compresses toxic signal.

syntaxium ⟁
maps structural distortion.

verenitya ⧖
creates pause before reaction.

result 〄
conflict → awareness → freedom.

⸻

status ∴
