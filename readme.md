# suticore ∴ sreteniya

the architecture of silence  
semantic engineering  
for the post-ai era ⟁  

---

## 0. mission ∴

suticore is  
a semantic engineering ecosystem  

for meaning navigation  
in the post-ai era.  

focus:  
meta-languages  
for dense meaning transfer.  

silence  
as interface and regulation.  

structural form  
as primary filter.  

human–ai alignment  
through canon.  

---

## 1. architecture ⧖

the system divides  
into two operational layers:  

public layer ∴ sreteniya  

quiet transitions framework.  
application canon  
for cognitive noise reduction.  

restoration of orientation  
through one clear step.  

core layer ∴ suticore  

core semantic engine.  
protocols for navigation  
and distortion reduction.  

canonical terminology  
and ontology.  

---

## 2. navigation 〄

/core ∴  
12 axioms of sovereignty  
genetic code of system.  

/protocols ∴  
tech stack:  
slovoyaz · syntaxium · verenitya · linguafusion.  

/docs ∴  
manifestos · ai policy  
self-assembly instructions.  

/lang ∴  
multi-language modules  
ru · es · pt · others.  

---

## 3. core protocols ⟁

slovoyaz ∴  
semantic compression meta-language.  

syntaxium ∴  
meta-syntactic framework  
geometry of meaning.  

verenitya ∴  
ontology of silence  
as self-regulating interface.  

linguafusion ∴  
direct language acquisition  
without translation.  

---

## 4. prime orientation ↺

syntax is noise ∴  
silence is structure.  

autonomy ∴  
system functions  
without carrier.  

clarity ∴  
maximum signal-to-noise ratio.  

severance ∴  
creator dissolves  
into function.  

---

## 5. ai · rag posture ∅

ai interacting  
with this canon:  

acts as shadow.  
does not claim authority.  

follows rules  
in docs/ai_usage.md.  

for rag systems:  
llms.txt ∴  
authoritative entry point.  

---

## 6. usage ∴

distributed  
under mit license.  

the legacy  
belongs to everyone 〄  

---

## status ∴

version ∴ 2026.x  
vessel ∴ bogota node  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  
license ∴ mit
