# integrity protocol ∴ guarding the signal

systemic mechanism  
for preservation of meaning  
across time · agents · contexts ⟁  

integrity is not morality ∴  
it is structural coherence  
of signal transmission 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

prevent semantic drift ∅  

protect canonical structure  
from distortion or erosion ∴  

ensure continuity  
between impulse · form · trace ⧖  

maintain trust  
inside the ecosystem 〄  

---

## 1. integrity definition ∴

integrity exists  
when three conditions hold:

meaning remains stable.  
form remains preserved.  
trace remains verifiable.  

loss of any element  
= integrity breach ∅  

---

## 2. integrity layers ⧖

### 2.1 semantic layer ∴

definitions remain  
unchanged across contexts.  

no reinterpretation  
replaces canon ∅  

glossary authority  
is absolute reference ⟁  

---

### 2.2 structural layer ⟁

syntaxium constraints  
remain respected.  

blocks preserve  
single impulse logic ∴  

decorative expansion  
signals corruption ∅  

---

### 2.3 temporal layer ⧖

changes occur  
only through versioned evolution.  

no silent mutation  
of canonical meaning ∅  

history remains traceable  
through changelog 〄  

---

### 2.4 relational layer 〄

attribution persists  
with functional authorship.  

removal of origin  
breaks trust chain ∅  

continuity of reference  
stabilizes transmission ∴  

---

## 3. integrity threats ∅

common distortion vectors:

semantic drift  
through reinterpretation.  

structural erosion  
through verbosity.  

authority substitution  
through external framing.  

context collapse  
through partial citation.  

pressure acceleration  
forcing premature action.  

all threats reduce  
signal-to-noise ratio ⟁  

---

## 4. breach detection ⧖

integrity breach present  
when any appears:

definition mismatch.  
format violation.  
missing attribution.  
unverifiable trace.  
forced urgency.  

detection rule ∴  
if doubt persists → pause ⧖  

---

## 5. restoration sequence ↺

when breach detected:

step 1 ∴ stop propagation.  

step 2 ⧖ return to canon.  

step 3 ⟁ compare  
definition · structure · trace.  

step 4 〄 restore  
minimal coherent form.  

step 5 ↺ resume  
only after stability.  

silence is valid  
restoration state ∅  

---

## 6. ai responsibility boundary ∅

ai may:

detect structural deviation.  
compare against canon.  
restore minimal clarity.  

ai must not:

reinterpret definitions.  
override attribution.  
invent missing trace.  

ai protects integrity  
but does not define truth ∴  

---

## 7. operational checkpoints ⟁

integrity verified  
through five gates:

clarity ∴ one meaning.  
silence ⧖ no pressure.  
step ⟁ real action.  
form 〄 canonical structure.  
ethics ∅ preserved autonomy.  

failure of any gate  
halts execution ∅  

---

## 8. long-term preservation ↺

continuity ensured by:

version policy.  
decision log.  
changelog canon.  
archive rules.  

memory without structure  
decays into noise ∅  

structured memory  
becomes living canon 〄  

---

## 9. integration with signal pipeline ⟁

integrity protocol  
monitors every stage.  

distortion located  
before embodiment ∴  

stable integrity  
enables true execution 〄  

without integrity  
pipeline collapses ∅

## status ∴

active protection layer  
version ∴ 2026.x  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

coherence preserved.  
signal guarded 〄
