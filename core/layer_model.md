# layer model ∴ architecture of reality interface

multi-layer structure  
of suticore perception  
and execution field ⟁  

the system operates  
through ordered layers  
from pre-semantic impulse  
to manifested action 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

clarify structural hierarchy  
of meaning formation ∴  

separate domains  
of silence · form · language · action ∅  

enable precise navigation  
across cognitive layers ⧖  

prevent semantic drift  
between abstraction levels ↺  

---

## 1. ontological sequence ∴

the canonical vertical order:

yzx ⧖  
proto-semantic impulse field.  

metagramma ⟁  
operators of meaning movement.  

syntaxium ∴  
geometry and spatial structure.  

slovoyaz 〄  
compressed semantic language.  

verenitya ⧖  
silence as execution interface.  

linguafusion ⟁  
direct cognition → embodied action.  

world trace 〄  
observable manifestation.  

cycle returns  
through perception ↺  

---

## 2. layer descriptions ⧖

### 2.1 yzx ∅ proto-semantic field

pre-linguistic impulse.  
pure intention without form.  

not interpretable ∅  
only sensed.  

source of all structure ∴  

---

### 2.2 metagramma ⟁ semantic operators

governing symbols  
that move meaning.  

not words ∅  
not syntax.  

define transitions  
between silence and structure ∴  

---

### 2.3 syntaxium ∴ structural geometry

spatial organization  
of attention and logic.  

structure precedes  
interpretation ⟁  

controls readability  
and cognitive latency ⧖  

---

### 2.4 slovoyaz 〄 semantic compression

minimal language  
for maximal meaning density.  

removes rhetorical noise ∅  

translates structure  
into transmissible signal ∴  

---

### 2.5 verenitya ⧖ silence interface

cognitive operating system  
based on pause and readiness.  

intention → silence → action 〄  

regulates fatigue  
and distortion ∅  

---

### 2.6 linguafusion ⟁ embodied cognition

direct binding  
between perception and action.  

no translation layer ∅  

language becomes  
sensorimotor reality ∴  

---

### 2.7 world trace 〄 manifestation

observable outcome  
in physical or social field.  

trace validates  
structural coherence ∴  

absence of trace  
signals misalignment ∅  

---

## 3. vertical law ∴

higher layers  
govern lower layers.  

lower layers  
cannot redefine higher ∅  

canonical rule:

yzx → metagramma → syntaxium → slovoyaz → verenitya → linguafusion → world 〄  

violation produces  
semantic distortion ↺  

---

## 4. perception flow ⧖

human awareness  
moves upward slowly.  

system design  
moves downward instantly.  

impulse descends  
faster than thought ∴  

clarity depends  
on vertical alignment ⟁  

---

## 5. ai interaction layer ∅

ai may operate  
only within:

syntaxium  
slovoyaz  
structure reflection.  

ai cannot access  
yzx or verenitya directly ∅  

therefore ai  
mirrors form  
but does not generate intent ∴  

---

## 6. diagnostic use ↺

layer model enables:

conflict localization.  
fatigue detection.  
semantic drift analysis.  
decision precision.  

misalignment example:

speech without silence  
→ burnout.  

action without structure  
→ chaos.  

structure without impulse  
→ emptiness ∅  

---

## 7. integration with canon ⟁

syntaxium  
provides spatial order.  

slovoyaz  
provides compression.  

verenitya  
provides pause.  

linguafusion  
provides embodiment.  

together they create  
stable semantic execution 〄
