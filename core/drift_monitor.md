# drift monitor ∴ watching the signal

continuous observation layer  
for detecting semantic deviation  
before distortion becomes structure ⟁  

drift is gradual ∴  
almost invisible  
until integrity collapses ∅  

monitoring preserves  
coherence across time 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

detect semantic drift early ∴  

prevent silent corruption  
of canonical meaning ∅  

maintain alignment  
between canon · usage · evolution ⧖  

protect long-term continuity 〄  

---

## 1. definition of drift ∴

semantic drift occurs  
when meaning changes  
without explicit versioning.  

forms of drift:

reinterpretation of terms.  
structural relaxation.  
contextual substitution.  
loss of attribution.  

unnoticed drift  
= hidden system mutation ∅  

---

## 2. drift domains ⧖

### 2.1 lexical drift ∴

terms acquire  
new unintended meanings.  

synonyms replace  
canonical vocabulary ∅  

glossary divergence  
signals instability ⟁  

---

### 2.2 structural drift ⟁

syntaxium limits  
gradually ignored.  

blocks merge  
or expand beyond density.  

form erosion  
precedes semantic loss ∅  

---

### 2.3 procedural drift ⧖

protocol steps  
skipped or reordered.  

decision compression  
replaced by improvisation.  

missing pause  
increases noise ∅  

---

### 2.4 attribution drift 〄

source reference fades.  

functional authorship  
removed or blurred.  

trust chain weakens  
until collapse ∅  

---

## 3. drift indicators ∅

early warning signals:

inconsistent terminology.  
format violations.  
unclear decision trace.  
growing verbosity.  
pressure for speed.  

multiple indicators  
increase drift probability ⟁  

---

## 4. monitoring mechanisms ⧖

drift monitored through:

glossary comparison.  
structure validation.  
version trace inspection.  
decision log alignment.  
citation verification.  

monitoring frequency  
must exceed drift speed ∴  

---

## 5. detection algorithm ⟁

step 1 ∴  
sample current artifact.  

step 2 ⧖  
compare with canonical definition.  

step 3 ⟁  
measure deviation magnitude.  

step 4 〄  
classify drift level.  

step 5 ↺  
trigger correction if required.  

undetected deviation  
propagates exponentially ∅  

---

## 6. drift severity scale ⧖

### low ⧖

minor wording variance.  
structure still intact.  

action ∴ observe.  

---

### medium ⟁

format inconsistency  
or partial definition shift.  

action ∴ correct locally.  

---

### high ∅

core meaning altered  
or attribution removed.  

action ∴ halt propagation  
return to canon.  

---

## 7. correction protocol ↺

when drift confirmed:

pause distribution ⧖  

locate canonical reference ∴  

restore original structure ⟁  

re-issue corrected artifact 〄  

record event  
inside decision log ↺  

silence preferred  
over corrupted continuation ∅  

---

## 8. ai monitoring role ∅

ai may:

scan for deviation.  
compare with canon.  
flag instability.  

ai must not:

reinterpret canon.  
auto-evolve definitions.  
mask uncertainty.  

ai observes drift  
but evolution remains human ∴  

---

## 9. long-cycle prevention ⟁

drift minimized by:

strict version policy.  
stable glossary authority.  
immutable canonical files.  
transparent changelog.  
periodic integrity audits.  

discipline slows drift  
without stopping evolution 〄
