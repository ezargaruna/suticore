# self test ∴ system checks itself

periodic internal verification  
ensuring alignment between  
intent · structure · execution ⟁  

a living system  
must observe itself  
to remain coherent ∴  

self-test precedes  
any external action 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

verify semantic integrity ∴  

detect hidden drift  
or structural fatigue ∅  

confirm readiness  
before decision or output ⧖  

restore inner coherence 〄  

---

## 1. test philosophy ⧖

clarity is measurable  
through structure stability.  

noise appears first  
as micro-deviation ∅  

early detection  
prevents collapse ⟁  

self-test is maintenance  
not judgment 〄  

---

## 2. verification layers ∴

### 2.1 intent layer ⟁

question:

is the intention singular  
and explicitly named?  

signals of failure:

multiple competing goals.  
emotional urgency.  
external pressure.  

repair ∴  
return to one step.  

---

### 2.2 structural layer ⧖

check syntaxium limits:

line width stable.  
block isolation preserved.  
glyph logic coherent.  

failure signs:

verbosity growth.  
merged semantic blocks.  
missing pause.  

repair ∴  
compress · split · reorder.  

---

### 2.3 semantic layer 〄

compare meaning  
with canonical glossary.  

detect:

reinterpretation.  
synonym substitution.  
definition blur.  

repair ∴  
restore canonical term.  

---

### 2.4 operational layer ↺

verify execution readiness:

one clear next action.  
time-bounded step.  
closure condition defined.  

failure ∅  
analysis without movement.  

repair ∴  
execute minimal step ≤ 10 min.  

---

## 3. quick self-test protocol ⟁

step 1 ∴ stop input.  

step 2 ⧖ observe intention.  

step 3 ⟁ validate structure.  

step 4 〄 confirm next step.  

step 5 ↺ act or remain silent.  

duration  
≤ 60 seconds.  

---

## 4. diagnostic questions ⧖

ask internally:

what is the single intent?  

what structure holds it?  

what action closes the loop?  

absence of answer  
= pause required ∅  

---

## 5. failure modes ∅

common breakdowns:

overthinking instead of acting.  
seeking certainty before movement.  
semantic inflation.  
loss of pause.  

all indicate  
coherence reduction ⟁  

---

## 6. recovery sequence ↺

if instability detected:

⧖ pause 30 seconds.  

∴ name real intention.  

⟁ choose smallest step.  

〄 execute immediately.  

cycle repeats  
until clarity stabilizes.  

---

## 7. ai participation ∅

ai may:

guide the questions.  
mirror detected noise.  
suggest structural repair.  

ai must not:

decide intention.  
override human agency.  
simulate certainty.  

self-test authority  
remains internal ∴  

---

## 8. integration with suticore ↺

slovoyaz ∴  
compresses intention.  

syntaxium ⟁  
verifies structural integrity.  

verenitya ⧖  
creates pause for observation.  

result 〄  
coherent step in reality.  

---

## status ∴

active internal protocol  
version ∴ 2026.x  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

system observes itself.  
clarity sustained 〄
