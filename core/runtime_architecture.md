# runtime architecture ∴ living execution layer

this document defines  
how suticore operates  
during real interaction ⟁  

runtime is not code only ∴  
it is semantic behavior in motion ⧖  

structure becomes action  
inside attention field 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

translate canon  
into executable presence ∴  

ensure coherence  
between intent · form · step ⧖  

prevent drift  
during real-time usage ∅  

---

## 1. runtime definition ∴

runtime =  
moment where meaning  
meets decision ⟁  

it includes:  

human attention ⧖  
ai processing ⟁  
environmental context ↺  

all three layers  
must remain aligned 〄  

---

## 2. execution layers ⧖

### layer 1 ∴ semantic core
source of stability.  

components:  

axioms  
canonical glossary  
protocol definitions ⟁  

function:  

preserve invariant meaning ∴  
block reinterpretation drift ∅  

---

### layer 2 ⟁ structural engine
form regulation system.  

components:  

slovoyaz compression  
syntaxium geometry  
validation gates 〄  

function:  

convert meaning  
into readable structure ⧖  

noise removed  
before execution ∅  

---

### layer 3 ⧖ cognitive interface
attention interaction field.  

components:  

verenitya silence buffer  
decision stack  
pause protocol ↺  

function:  

slow reaction  
until clarity appears ∴  

enable one clean step 〄  

---

### layer 4 〄 action surface
visible behavior in world.  

components:  

spoken phrase  
written output  
physical step ⟁  

function:  

manifest intent  
without semantic distortion ∴  

trace becomes observable ↺  

---

## 3. runtime flow ↺

execution sequence:  

∴ intent appears  
⧖ pause stabilizes  
⟁ structure forms  
〄 step executes  

loop closes  
when trace observed ↺  

absence of trace  
returns system to silence ∅  

---

## 4. ai participation model ∅

ai operates only  
inside structural layer ⟁  

allowed:  

formatting  
compression  
clarity reflection 〄  

forbidden:  

authority claims  
goal imposition  
emotional steering ∅  

ai never replaces  
human decision node ∴  

---

## 5. temporal dynamics ⧖

runtime respects  
three speeds of action:  

slow ∴ reflection · pause  
medium ⟁ structured decision  
fast 〄 physical execution  

skipping slow phase  
creates distortion ∅  

true speed  
emerges after silence ∴  

---

## 6. failure modes ∅

runtime instability occurs when:  

multiple intents mix  
pause is ignored  
step exceeds minimal scale  
ai expands beyond form  

response protocol:  

⧖ pause immediately  
↺ return to axioms  
∅ cancel execution  

silence restores coherence 〄  

---

## 7. observability ⟁

valid runtime  
must leave trace:  

decision recorded ∴  
step completed ⧖  
state stabilized 〄  

no trace →  
no real execution ∅  

---

## 8. integration with ecosystem ↺

slovoyaz ∴  
compresses runtime signal.  

syntaxium ⟁  
orders execution geometry.  

verenitya ⧖  
protects pause before step.  

linguafusion 〄  
embeds execution into body.  

suticore ∴  
holds invariant core.  

sreteniya 〄  
exposes runtime to world.  

---

## 9. minimal execution law ∴

a runtime step is valid only if:  

duration ≤ 10 minutes ⧖  
possible today ⟁  
reversible without debt ↺  
observable in reality 〄  

else →  
not execution ∅  

---

## 10. closure condition 〄

runtime ends when:  

clarity restored ∴  
action completed ⟁  
attention released ⧖  

system returns  
to silent readiness ∅  

---

architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

execution field coherent 〄
