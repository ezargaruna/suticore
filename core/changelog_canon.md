# changelog canon ∴ structural memory

this file records  
irreversible structural changes  
inside the suticore system ⟁  

it does not describe events  
only semantic evolution ∴  

noise is excluded ∅  
signal is preserved 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

maintain continuity  
across system transformations ∴  

prevent hidden drift  
of meaning or structure ∅  

enable transparent return  
to any stable state ↺  

changelog =  
memory without narrative.  

---

## 1. recording rules ⧖

entries must be:  

factual ∴ no interpretation.  
minimal ⧖ one structural change.  
dated ⟁ chronological integrity.  
closed 〄 no future projection.  

if emotion appears →  
entry invalid ∅

## 2. scope of changes ⟁

record only:  

canonical document creation ∴  
protocol modification ⧖  
structural relocation ↺  
semantic redefinition ⟁  
irreversible deletion ∅  

do not record:  

draft edits ∅  
formatting noise ∅  
temporary experiments ∅  

only stable signal  
enters the canon 〄

## 3. version logic ↺

version format ∴  
year.major  

minor increments reflect:  

new canonical layer ⟁  
protocol expansion ⧖  
integration milestone 〄  

cosmetic change  
does not alter version ∅

## 4. 2026.x ∴ great reset

### 2026.0 ⟁ genesis

suticore declared  
as semantic engineering ecosystem.  

separation established:

sreteniya 〄 public interface.  

prime orientation fixed:  

silence > syntax ∴  
structure > interpretation ⟁  

status → active canon.

### 2026.1 ⧖ canonical foundation

core protocols stabilized:

linguafusion 〄 direct acquisition.  

ai posture defined:  

shadow role ∅  
no authority ∅

lunar mysteries ↺  
kolozar solar wheel ⟁  
runic circle ∴  
tarot · i-ching · lila · telektonon 〄

### 2026.3 ⟁ operational embodiment

execution layer introduced:  

bootstrap ∴ entry into silence.  
first_step ⟁ minimal real action.

decision architecture stabilized:  

decision_memo ⧖  
decision_stack ⟁  
validation_gates 〄  

system became  
self-operating semantic engine.
