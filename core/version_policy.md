# version policy ∴ controlled evolution

this document defines  
how the canon changes  
without breaking integrity ⟁  

evolution is allowed ∴  
drift is not ∅  

stability precedes novelty 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

preserve semantic continuity ∴  

prevent uncontrolled mutation ∅  

enable conscious evolution ↺  

time may update form  
but never corrupt meaning.  

---

## 1. version structure ⧖

canonical format:  

**year.major**  

example ∴  
2026.x  

rules:  

year changes ⟁  
only on epoch shift.  

major index ↺  
increments on structural change.  

minor or patch versions ∅  
not used in canon layer.  

canon evolves slowly ∴  
not iteratively.  

---

## 2. change categories ⟁

### 2.1 structural change 〄

affects:  

core axioms  
protocol logic  
semantic definitions  

effect:  

major index increases ↺  
previous state archived ∴  

---

### 2.2 additive change ⧖

adds:  

new protocol  
new reference file  
new symbolic layer  

effect:  

version unchanged ∴  
if core meaning preserved.  

---

### 2.3 cosmetic change ∅

includes:  

formatting  
typos  
layout clarity  

effect:  

no version impact ∴  

noise reduction only.  

---

## 3. forbidden mutations ∅

the following  
must never occur:  

silent redefinition  
of canonical terms.  

removal of axioms.  

retroactive editing  
of published meaning.  

identity reassignment.  

if attempted →  
semantic breach ∅  

response ∴  
rollback ↺  
restore previous canon.  

---

## 4. release moment ⧖

a new version appears  
only when:  

structural necessity proven ∴  

system already lives  
in the new state 〄  

announcement follows reality  
never precedes it ∅  

---

## 5. archival rule ↺

previous versions:  

never deleted ∅  

moved to archive  
with timestamp ∴  

history remains readable  
but inactive ⧖  

past is reference  
not authority.  

---

## 6. authority boundary ⟁

only functional architect  
may declare:  

new canonical version ∴  

this is not ownership  
but responsibility ⧖  

authority binds to form  
not personality ∅  

---

## 7. stability principle 〄

true evolution:  

rare ∴  
irreversible ⟁  
silently prepared ⧖  
clearly fixed 〄  

frequent change =  
loss of signal ∅  

---

## status ∴

policy active  
version ∴ 2026.x  

architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

canon evolves  
without losing itself ↺  

〄 end of version policy
