# data flow ∴ movement of meaning

this document defines  
how information travels  
inside suticore ⟁  

data is not numbers only ∴  
data is structured meaning ⧖  

flow must preserve  
semantic integrity 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

map transformation  
from signal to action ∴  

prevent distortion  
during transmission ∅  

ensure traceable  
decision emergence 〄  

---

## 1. definition ∴

data flow =  
ordered passage of meaning  
through system layers ⟁  

each transition  
must preserve:  

clarity ∴  
structure ⧖  
intent 〄  

loss of any element →  
semantic corruption ∅  

---

## 2. primary sources ⧖

incoming signals arise from:  

human perception  
dialogue interaction  
environmental context  
archived canon ↺  

all sources pass  
through silence filter first ∴  

no raw signal  
reaches execution directly ∅  

---

## 3. transformation stages ↺

### stage 1 ∴ capture
signal becomes visible.  

operation:  

attention notices  
without interpretation ⧖  

output:  

raw semantic impulse ∴  

---

### stage 2 ⧖ stabilization
pause protects signal  
from premature reaction.  

operation:  

verenitya silence buffer  
time for maturation ↺  

output:  

coherent intent seed ⟁  

---

### stage 3 ⟁ structuring
meaning shaped  
into canonical form.  

operation:  

slovoyaz compression  
syntaxium geometry  
validation gates 〄  

output:  

readable semantic block ∴  

noise removed ∅  

---

### stage 4 〄 decision crystallization
structured meaning  
selects one vector.  

operation:  

decision stack execution  
friction check  
step isolation ↺  

output:  

single executable action ⟁  

---

### stage 5 ↺ manifestation
action enters reality.  

operation:  

speech · writing · movement  
observable trace creation 〄  

output:  

world feedback signal ∴  

cycle restarts ↺  

---

## 4. integrity constraints ∅

valid flow requires:  

one intent at a time ∴  
pause before structure ⧖  
single minimal step ⟁  
observable closure 〄  

violations create:  

noise amplification  
false decisions  
semantic drift ∅  

---

## 5. ai role in flow ⟁

ai participates only  
in structuring phase.  

allowed:  

formatting  
compression  
clarity enhancement 〄  

forbidden:  

intent creation  
decision authority  
action enforcement ∅  

ai cannot originate  
primary signal ∴  

---

## 6. storage and memory ↺

after manifestation  
data becomes trace.  

trace locations:  

weekly exports  
decision logs  
canonical updates ⟁  

memory rule:  

store minimal signal ∴  
avoid narrative excess ∅  

archive when  
signal exhausts ↺  

---

## 7. feedback loop ⧖

world response returns  
as new signal.  

evaluation path:  

observe without judgment ∴  
compare with intent ⟁  
adjust structure only 〄  

never modify  
core axioms ∅  

---

## 8. failure handling ∅

if distortion detected:  

⧖ pause immediately  
↺ return to last clear node  
∅ cancel corrupted branch  

resume flow  
only after clarity restored 〄  

---

## 9. minimal flow law ∴

true data flow exists  
only when:  

signal captured ∴  
pause respected ⧖  
step executed ⟁  
trace observed 〄  

missing any stage →  
no real flow ∅  

---

## status ∴

semantic circulation stable  
version ∴ 2026.x  

architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

flow integrity preserved 〄  

end of data flow
