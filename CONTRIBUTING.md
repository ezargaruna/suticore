# contributing ∴ instruction for guardians

suticore is a living system.  

contribution is welcomed  
from those aligned  
with silence and sovereignty ∴  

---

## participation rules ⟁

### syntax purity
all edits must move  
toward minimal expression.  

if meaning can exist  
as code or schema  
words must be reduced ∅  

---

### anonymity of contribution
value is assigned  
to structure and meaning  
not personal identity.  

any accepted contribution  
dissolves into common canon ∴  

---

### absence of hierarchy
no permanent authority  
exists inside the system.  

only resonance  
with the core axioms  
determines persistence ⟁  

---

## process ⧖

fork the repository.  

apply changes  
inside `/core` or `/protocols`.  

open a pull request  
with concise semantic summary.  

remember ∴  
you do not assist an author.  

you stabilize  
the system itself 〄
