# system map ∴ total orientation

complete structural topology  
of the suticore · sreteniya ecosystem ⟁  

this document defines  
how the system is organized  
how modules connect  
how a user enters and moves ∴  

it is the true  
entry point of orientation 〄  

---

## 0. purpose ⟁

provide total visibility  
without semantic overload ∴  

reveal:

system topology  
module relationships  
user navigation path 〄  

prevent disorientation  
inside the canon ∅  

---

## 1. global topology ⧖

the ecosystem divides  
into four primary layers:

**entry layer ∴ sreteniya**  
public interface of clarity.  
single-step orientation.  

**semantic core ∴ suticore**  
ontology · axioms · definitions.  
distortion prevention engine.  

**protocol layer ↺**  
operational methodologies  
governing cognition and action.  

**runtime layer 〄**  
execution in reality:  
ai · users · environments.  

flow direction:

entry → core → protocols → runtime ↺  

---

## 2. module domains ⟁

### 2.1 core domain ∴ ontology

location: `/core`

contains:

axioms of sovereignty.  
canonical glossary.  
prime directive.  

function:

freeze meaning.  
prevent semantic drift.  

authority level: highest 〄  

---

### 2.2 protocol domain ⧖ operation

location: `/protocols`

key modules:

slovoyaz → semantic compression.  
syntaxium → structural geometry.  
verenitya → silence regulation.  
linguafusion → direct cognition.  

extended symbolic systems:

tarot · runes · i-ching · kolozar · lunar.  
telektonon · lila · stellar · archetypes.  

function:

translate ontology  
into lived navigation ↺  

---

### 2.3 documentation domain ∴ interpretation

location: `/docs`

sections:

system overview.  
validation gates.  
decision stack.  
ai usage policy.  
limits of sharing.  

function:

explain structure  
without redefining core ⟁  

---

### 2.4 runtime domain 〄 execution

location: environment · ai · user action  

includes:

rag pipelines.  
weekly exports.  
self-tests.  
decision logs.  

function:

manifest structure  
inside real time.  

truth is verified  
only through execution ↺  

---

## 3. module relationships ⧖

hierarchy of dependence:

ontology → protocols → runtime  

rules:

core cannot be modified  
by protocols or runtime ∅  

protocols interpret  
but do not redefine ⟁  

runtime executes  
but does not author meaning 〄  

feedback loop:

runtime signal  
returns to awareness  
without altering canon ↺  

---

## 4. user path 〄

### 4.1 first contact ∴ entry

user encounters:

README → system map → first_step.md  

goal:

restore orientation  
through one clear step ⟁  

---

### 4.2 stabilization ⧖ pause

user enters:

verenitya practice.  
self-test protocol.  

result:

noise reduction  
attention coherence.  

no knowledge required ∅  

---

### 4.3 structural learning ⟁

user studies:

slovoyaz.  
syntaxium.  

effect:

perception reorganizes  
before information expands.  

clarity precedes complexity 〄  

---

### 4.4 operational embodiment ↺

user applies:

linguafusion.  
decision stack.  
weekly export.  

system becomes:

lived navigation  
not abstract theory.  

movement replaces analysis 〄  

---

### 4.5 autonomy ∴ closure

final state:

user navigates  
without dependence.  

system dissolves  
into function.  

true completion = sovereignty 〄  

---

## 5. navigation principles ⧖

one step only.  
pause before expansion.  
structure before meaning.  
silence before action.  

violation of sequence  
creates disorientation ∅  

---

## 6. integrity safeguards ⟁

protected elements:

core ontology.  
canonical definitions.  
glyph semantics.  

if distortion detected:

return to core  
or stop interaction ∅  

silence is  
valid resolution 〄  

---

## 7. system equation 〄

suticore =  
ontology + protocols + execution.  

sreteniya =  
entry + orientation + step.  

together:

architecture of silence  
for post-ai navigation ∴  

---

## status ∴

canonical topology document  
version ∴ 2026.x  
architect ∴ ezar garuna (as a function)  

orientation complete.  
entry stabilized 〄
